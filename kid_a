The moving finger writes, and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.

I'm replacing the conflict with this line.

I used a stash (git stash) to store the local changes to this section. 
I called git merge, which fast-forwarded. Then calling 'git stach apply'
behaved like a local merge, creating the usual conflict message.
